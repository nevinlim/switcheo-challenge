## The Computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns

    import statements are missing.

    The props interface is empty, there are no props defined, so technically WalletPage can utilize BoxProps directly instead.

    children is declared but never used.

    useWalletBalances method is not declared before usage.

    useState has no initial values passed into it.

    console.err is mistyped, should be console.error

    getPrices and setPrices are not declared too.

    lhsPriority is never declared and balancePriority is not used, its probably a typo.
